Q: Create a directory named /common. Allow john and davis to share documents in the /common directory using a group called team. Both of them can read, write and remove documents from the other in this directory but any user not member of the group canâ€™t.

(Assuming john and davis users have been created before.)

1- Create /common directory:
   sudo mkdir /common

2- Create the team group
   groupadd team

3- Add the users to team group:
   usermod davis -G team
   usermod john -G team

4- Change /common's group to team
   chgrp team /common

5- Give specified permissions for /common:
   chmod 770 /common
