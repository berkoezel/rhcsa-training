Q: Create a logical volume of 200MB called lv_swap2 and add it permanently to the current swap space.

(Assuming volume group is created before)

1: Create the logical volume first:
   lvcreate <vg name> -L 200 -n lv_swap2

2: Make the logical volume as swap space:
   mkswap /dev/mapper/path/to/the/lv

3: Activate the swap partition:
   swapon /dev/mapper/path/to/the/lv

4: Add the LV to /etc/fstab by creating new line:
   /dev/mapper/path/to/the/lv      none                    swap    defaults        0 0

5: Verify the /etc/fstab is correct by remounting:
   mount -a
