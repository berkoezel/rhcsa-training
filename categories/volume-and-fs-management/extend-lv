Q: Extend the existing xfs file system to a total size of 200MB

1- Check existing filesystems with lsblk first

2- Umount the filesystem if it's already mounted:
   umount /dev/mapper/<logical_volume>

3- Extend logical volume and notice the filesystem is about to extended:
   lvextend -L +200M -r /dev/mapper/<logical_volume>
